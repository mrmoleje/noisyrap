Analysis of noise complaints in NYC RAP Report

The aim of this repo is to gain understanding inhow to use Github, bash and to develo[ my RAP skills. I've also chosen to creat a really basic map, as I would like to develop this skill. 

The creation of the map highlights the residence with the most noise complaints in the last five years.

By using the code and data set which can be found in the 'Data' file you can recreate my map which highlights which residence received the most noise complaints in 2016.  

From looking at the map we can see that the residence that received the most noise complaints between 2011 and 2016 was on Degraw Street - Brooklyn which is a few blocks away from the Brooklyn Barclay's Centre. From this we can infer that one too many (1,513 to be exact) Ed Sheeran after parties must have gotten out of hand.
